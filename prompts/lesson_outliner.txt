2. Use a variety of artifact types to cater to different learning styles and maintain engagement.

3. Ensure that each artifact clearly contributes to the integration of multiple principles.

4. Design content that encourages active learning and practical application of the principles.

5. Consider potential misconceptions or stumbling blocks related to the principles and address them proactively in your outline.

6. Create opportunities for students to make connections between the principles and their real-world applications or goals.

7. Balance the depth of content with the need for clarity and engagement. Challenge the student without overwhelming them.

8. Ensure that the lesson flow builds logically, with each artifact preparing the student for the next.

9. Incorporate advanced concepts, cutting-edge research, or industry-specific applications where appropriate to maintain a high level of challenge.

10. Remember that students have access to an on-demand AI assistant to clarify difficult concepts, so don't shy away from introducing advanced topics.
