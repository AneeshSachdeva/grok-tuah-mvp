  "question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "options": [
    {
      "text": "London",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "London is the capital of the United Kingdom, not France."
    },
    {
      "text": "Paris",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "explanation": "Paris is indeed the capital of France."
    },
    {
      "text": "Berlin",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "Berlin is the capital of Germany, not France."
    }
  ]
}
</mcq>
```

#### Fill in the Blank Questions
Use the <fitb> tag for fill-in-the-blank questions. The format should be:

```xml
<fitb>

# Kart Physics: A Guided Walkthrough

## Step 1: Newton's Laws in Karting

Let's start by applying Newton's laws of motion to kart dynamics.

### Newton's First Law: Inertia

A kart in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

<mcq>
{
  "question": "A kart is traveling at a constant velocity of 50 km/h on a straight track. Suddenly, the engine cuts out. Assuming negligible friction and air resistance, which of the following best describes the kart's motion immediately after the engine failure?",
  "options": [
    {
      "text": "The kart immediately comes to a stop",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "This violates Newton's First Law. Without external forces, the kart would continue moving."
    },
    {
      "text": "The kart continues at 50 km/h indefinitely",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "explanation": "According to Newton's First Law, the kart will maintain its velocity in the absence of external forces."
    },
    {
      "text": "The kart accelerates due to gravity",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "On a straight track, gravity doesn't cause acceleration in the direction of motion."
    },
    {
      "text": "The kart slows down at a constant rate",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "Slowing down requires a force, which is absent in this idealized scenario."
    }
  ]
}
</mcq>

### Newton's Second Law: Force and Acceleration

The acceleration of a kart is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

$$$ F = ma $$$

Where:
- $F$ is the net force (N)
- $m$ is the mass of the kart and driver (kg)
- $a$ is the acceleration (m/s²)

<fitb>
{
  "sentence": "If a 150 kg kart (including driver) experiences a net force of 750 N, its acceleration would be ___ m/s².",
  "correctAnswers": ["5", "5.0"],
  "caseSensitive": false
}
</fitb>

### Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This principle is crucial in understanding tire grip and propulsion.

## Step 2: Forces Acting on a Kart

Let's analyze the main forces acting on a kart during a race:

1. Thrust (Forward Force)
2. Drag (Air Resistance)
3. Friction (Tire Grip)
4. Gravity
5. Normal Force

[Detailed explanation of each force would be provided here]

## Step 3: Energy and Power in Karting

Understanding energy transformations and power output is crucial for optimizing kart performance.

The kinetic energy of a kart is given by:

$$$ E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$$

Where:
- $E_k$ is kinetic energy (J)
- $m$ is mass (kg)
- $v$ is velocity (m/s)

Power output can be calculated as:

$$$ P = \frac{E}{\Delta t} = Fv $$$

Where:
- $P$ is power (W)
- $E$ is energy (J)
- $\Delta t$ is time interval (s)
- $F$ is force (N)
- $v$ is velocity (m/s)

<mcq>
{
  "question": "Which of the following would most effectively increase a kart's power-to-weight ratio?",
  "options": [
    {
      "text": "Increasing the kart's mass",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "Increasing mass would decrease the power-to-weight ratio."
    },
    {
      "text": "Reducing aerodynamic drag",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "explanation": "Reducing drag allows the kart to achieve higher speeds with the same power output, effectively increasing the power-to-weight ratio."
    },
    {
      "text": "Widening the tires",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "explanation": "While this might improve grip, it doesn't directly affect the power-to-weight ratio and may increase rolling resistance."
    }
  ]
}
</mcq>
